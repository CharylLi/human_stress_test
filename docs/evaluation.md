## Usability and Utility Evaluation: SUS Testing

Overall, our app’s system usability scale evaluated to the marginal and acceptable score ranges. One thing to note is that we SUS tested our app with the first seven students when we didn’t finish implementing our app in commit ad4922c9. The last two students who did SUS testing looked at commit 163a0a49. 

After asking nine students to answer the ten system usability scale questions, these are the overall scores in order: 69, 77.5, 77.5, 67.5, 67.5, 52.5, 82.5, 90, 50. Most of the overall scores are above the average SUS score of 68 out of 100, indicating that our app’s usability addresses the needs we designed for. 

The learnability subscores are: 100, 37.5, 100, 100, 62.5, 87.5, 87.5, 100, 100. The high scores signify that our app is easy to understand and use without advanced knowledge. There is one low subscore of 37.5, but we have fixed our bugs after that particular SUS testing session.

The usability subscores are: 96.875, 87.5, 71.875, 62.5, 68.75, 62.5, 81.25, 87.5, ​​59.375. The subscores for this section shows that our app isn’t unnecessarily complex to use, but a few did find it cumbersome to use.
