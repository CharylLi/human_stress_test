## Changes We Made After Peer Audit

We changed our 'leaderboard' tab in the bottom navigation bar to 'stats' since it was misleading to call it a leaderboard if it's just the user's statistics. We also renamed the drawing canvas view where the user plays the memory game to 'Drawing Board' so it's more obvious that it's the point of that view.

We got additional helpful feedback from our peer audit about problems with text resizing on our main menu buttons and our app's lack of landscape compatibility on phones, but we just didn't have the time to make changes after getting the feedback so we left it as is.
