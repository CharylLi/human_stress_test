## Addressing a Human Need
The problem that we are trying to solve is relieving stress as quick as possible. Our solution is short mini games that users can play when they’re stressed. One way to reduce stress is doing leisure activities, and games is such one leisure activity. According to the article, “The Link Between Video Games and Stress Relief,” most gamers report that playing video games is a way to relieve stress (Scott, 2024). Skill-building games promotes brain power or specific abilities in addition to taking the user’s mind off their stress. Furthermore, skill-building games such as puzzles will help build problem-solving abilities and organization skills, two efficient abilities for stress relief (Scott, 2024). 

For our app, we’ve published three stress-reducing games. These are considered “casual games,” games played for a short period of time. According to the Casual Games Market Report, findings were determined that stress relief was the “number one reason participants gave for playing casual games” (Stanhope, 2015, p.3). With our app, our users will have fun while reducing their stress.
